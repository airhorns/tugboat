  # This container is for manual invocation via `docker-compose run shell bash`.
  # It's handy to be able to mess around in a set up environment with the same dependencies and environment
  # as the rest of the services, but, we don't generally need it running in the background. So, this sets it all up
  # but we execute a command (true) that exits immediately to keep the container stopped by default.
